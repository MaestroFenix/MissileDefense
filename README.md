MissileDefense
==============

Code for the fixed and improved npc_missiledefense of Half-Life 2, with all the needed assets (including model and fgd!).

Taken from the original code found at the retail version of Half-Life 2. All the rights are part of Valve Corporation, I only
take credits for the fixes at the code, as well as the new model, test map and fgd data.
